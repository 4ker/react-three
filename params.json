These components represent\r\nthe basic primitives found in three.js such as Mesh, Scene, Object3D.\r\n\r\nTo create a 3D scene you can create and compose React-three components just as you would compose DOM elements in vanilla React. An example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar Cupcake = React.createClass({\r\n  displayName: 'Cupcake',\r\n  render: function() {\r\n    return ReactTHREE.Object3D(\r\n      {rotation:this.props.rotation, position:new THREE.Vector3(0,0,0)},\r\n      ReactTHREE.Mesh({position:new THREE.Vector3(0,-100,0), geometry:boxgeometry, material:cupcakematerial}),\r\n      ReactTHREE.Mesh({position:new THREE.Vector3(0, 100,0), geometry:boxgeometry, material:creammaterial})\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
